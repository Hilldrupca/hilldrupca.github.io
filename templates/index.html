            <h5>Applied Data Science with Python</h5>
            <p class='indented'>
                All of my work for the Coursera specialization of the same name. The following python modules were used: matplotlib, networkx, nltk, pandas, and scikit-learn.

            <h5>Data Structures and Beyond Capstone Project</h5>
            <p class='indented'>
                A java capstone project for a Coursera specialization of the same name. Explores the modeling of information cascades through a graph. A real world example of such a case would be the sudden increase in popularity of a new trend.

            <h5>Nutrition Calculator</h5>
            <p class='indented'>
                A meal planner that uses data provided by the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. Currently uses SR28 (2015) data. I've also ported the project to a Flask application running on the Google Cloud Platform.

    <h2>Tutorials:</h2>
        <p class='indented'>
            Here I'll explain at least one solution to problems I found interesting. When it comes to algorithms, my goal is to emulate the spirit of <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org'>GeeksforGeeks</a>. This may also include how to use modules like pandas, networkx, etc.
